# Automated Login Script for Online Quran School

This script automates the login process for my online Quran school. It addresses scenarios where the login link may be delayed and does not become available precisely at 6 AM. Rather than manually refreshing the website, the script waits for the link to be accessible and then performs the login automatically.

**Note:** To use this script, you must have valid login credentials for the online Quran school. If you have an account, you can log in at [https://new.maqraa.sa/student](https://new.maqraa.sa/student). The script is customizable and can be adjusted to fit your needs after reviewing the code.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
